## What?

I am the programming captain on team 5401, and it is apart of my job to makesure my students are competent and understand java. Here is the FIZZ-BUZZ programming challenge, however each branch has a bug that is to be solved!

## Why?

FIZZ-BUZZ is a simple intro to Java/algorithms, and as so should be reasonable to debug with issues!

# Please enjoy!
